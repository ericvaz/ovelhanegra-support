# Changelog

All notable changes to **32Parts** are documented in this file.

The project follows a calm, iterative release philosophy: small, intentional changes that deepen the contemplative experience rather than expanding surface features.

---

## [Unreleased]
- Exploration mode (mapping and body navigation) in active design.
- Refinements to Rest (Sleep) audio behavior and transitions.

---

## [1.1] — 30.12.25

### Added
- Introduced a new three-mode home structure with vertically aligned primary actions:
  - **Mindfulness**
  - **Rest**
  - **Exploration**
- Added a dedicated **Rest (Sleep)** experience, offering a minimal sleep meditation flow with selectable ambient soundscapes.

### Improved
- Redesigned the landing screen to establish a clear vertical, body-aligned interaction axis.
- Refined spacing and layout to ensure the bottom utility menu (guide, info, settings) remains visible across all device sizes.
- Improved overall visual hierarchy for a calmer, more artifact-like home screen.

### Assets
- Standardized all primary icon assets by converting PNGs to single-stroke vector artwork in Adobe Illustrator.
- Removed baked-in background colors via Image Trace (3-color trace with advanced refinement), exporting transparent assets for seamless blending with the app’s base tone.

---

## [1.0] — Initial Release
- Core 32 Parts mindfulness meditation experience.
- Guided body contemplation with configurable breathing techniques.
- Minimal, distraction-free interface focused on stillness and awareness.
